# My Neovim Config

Nothing special or fancy here, but I dig it.

I use [JuliaMono](https://juliamono.netlify.app/) and the [Hack Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

## Installation

I know that you'll need to install:
* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
* [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui)

Once you're in, `:ReloadConfig` or `:PackerSync` should get you going.
